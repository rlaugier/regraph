# Regraph

Regraph is a tool to help visualize complex requirement matrices.

## Setup:

Use:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rlaugier/regraph/
cd regraph
python setup.py install
```
or
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/rlaugier/regraph
```
But then you would have to download the `regraph_gui.py` separately.

## Getting started

Start the gui:
```
cd regraph/gui/
streamlit run regraph_gui.py
```
